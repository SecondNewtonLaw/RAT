# RAT

This is a Discord RAT that I wrote as a challenge, it's __NOT__ meant on ANYWAY to cause harm, _at least not right now_, the code is on early stages.

## Functionality

- Ping
- Rebuild Slash Commands Remotely.

## Priority

- 0 (Now)
- 1 (Can Wait)
- 2 (Ok this might take some time)

### Planned

- (1) Auto Updater
- (0) Multi-Victim System (WIP)
- (1) IP Grabbing
- (2) File Uploader
- (2) File Downloader
- (0) Shell
- (2) Privilage Escalation (Windows Only)
- (2) Linux + Windows Support (Yes, I'm using Linux to test this no joke)

For obvious reasons, this project was not written with the intent to harm anyone.
